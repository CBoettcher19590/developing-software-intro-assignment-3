Hello Jr. Developer.

I've read the letter from the Product Manager. I've started a repository with the old application, a couple new libraries to help us accomplish this assignment, and I refactored how we include the commands, in anticiptation of at least on more. There's a [readme](../src/house/readme.md) in the `src/house` folder to help you understand the new tools.

I need you to create a new epic for this upgrade on the project board, and create the user stories Rosa provided in that epic. Once you've created the stories, add sub-tasks that identify how we're going to accomplish the stories.

After creating your tasks, complete them.

A few additional notes for you:

  - Make sure that you update the root readme.md with instructions on how to run the new program.

  - Don't change any code in the `src/house` folder. I haven't finished the tests for it yet and I don't want unexpected outcomes

  - Remember to keep your board up to date as you work on the application!

  - I've seperated the old calculation into the `src/commands` folder. Please follow suit if you add any more commands.

Thanks,


Steve,

Sr. Developer
