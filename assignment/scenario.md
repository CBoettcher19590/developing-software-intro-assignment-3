# Scenario

Gerald is enjoying the application we've written for him, but he's running into a few issues:

  1. He can't see the results of prior houses without knowing the dimensions

  2. He can only calculate houses that have exact feet in length (i.e. He can calculate an 8 foot x 8 foot house, but not an 8 foot 3 inch x 8 foot 3 inch house).

To tackle these requirements, a Sr. Developer (Steve) and Product Manager (Rosa) have been brought onto the project, and you will be assisting the them. This repo has code changes from the Sr. Developer and user stories from the Product Manager on how to use his new features, plus his list of tasks for you to do.
